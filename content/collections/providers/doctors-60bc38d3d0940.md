  ProCare Hospice is family-owned and operated. We are involved with what happens every day. Our core values are the values of a family. We celebrate families of all kinds. We know how important family members are to each other. We understand that what happens to a family member doesn’t happen in a vacuum — it affects everyone in the family.

  From the administrative side to the bedside, we know it’s important for every member of the team to feel heard and have a safe, caring work environment. Our goals as a company are to build the strongest and constantly-growing team we can, to better provide our community with the hospice care it deserves.

  ProCare Hospice is unique among the over 100 hospices in the Southern Nevada area. Our mission is always to find out the best way our family can help your family at the end of life.

  ProCare’s CareOusel hospice care program offers a model of care unlike others. Hospice care generally requires a patient to forgo any treatments attempting to cure them (such as radiation, chemotherapy, etc.) and instead, focus on comfort and quality of life treatments. CareOusel’s program allows pediatric patients to continue any therapies parents feel adds quality to the child’s life.

  Our focus for the children in our care is to provide compassionate pain and symptom management. We strive to provide as much quality of life as possible. We do all we can so that parents can be parents, kids can be kids and families can be families. 

  We work to minimize suffering, enhance the quality of life and through our specialized care team, make sure that a family’s time together can be filled with love. We believe the quality of a child’s life is not defined solely by their physical health, but by the opportunity to still be a kid.
