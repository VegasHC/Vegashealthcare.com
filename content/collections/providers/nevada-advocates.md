  Patient Advocacy & Life Care Management in Nevada

  Welcome to Nevada Advocates. Since 2016, we have been helping individuals, families, and professionals across the Las Vegas area manage the complexities of life. As experienced life care managers, we are experts at navigating life’s transitions; skilled at advocating for our client’s needs, and we possess a thorough understanding of the resources available to help seniors and individuals with disabilities live a full life.

  What is Life Care Management?
  A life care manager is someone who is “in your corner” providing you with expert advice and guidance. Your life care manager is your partner, helping you navigate difficult decisions and ready to speak up on your behalf when your voice isn’t being heard.

  While life care managers help their clients in almost every way imaginable, their assistance generally falls into one of four categories:
  Navigate
  Coordinate
