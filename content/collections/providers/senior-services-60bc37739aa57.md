  At Essential Care, we believe in providing compassionate, quality, innovative personal care care with a focus on personalization, transparency, and ongoing communication. We strive to achieve the highest standard in the industry by providing prompt, courteous, and professional service 24-hours a day, seven days a week to clients who need personal care at an affordable rate. 

  We carefully select our caregivers through meticulous background screening and interviews, insuring we only select those who meet our high standards. Every caregiver hired is then trained to assist with a variety of activities such as: assistance with bathing, running errands, light housekeeping, meal prep, medication reminders, Alzheimer's and dementia care, and more. 

  These personalized services are available seven days a week and can range from a few hours daily to 24 hours and live-in care. Call us to set up a complimentary assessment where we will meet with you and your family to jointly determine the scope of care you (or your loved one) need and how Essential Care can help.
