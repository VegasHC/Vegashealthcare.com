  Sonoma Home Health is a family owned and operated Home Health agency that has been in operation for nearly 17 years. We are proud to say that we are ACHC accredited, meaning that we meet and exceed Medicare's guidelines for providing care. Our team, composed of compassionate, caring and hard working individuals, is what makes our agency a success. The quality care and attention given to each patient and their families is evident in our patient survey results. Sonoma Home Health's approach to home health is to treat each patient as if they were a member of our own family, because they are. 

  Sonoma Home Health provides skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy and social work to our patients in a way that is supportive and caring. 
  We are able to assist our patients and their families 24 hours per day, and a real person will answer your call, no matter the time of day.

  Please contact us if you have any questions or would like to get started on our service. We look forward to hearing from you.
