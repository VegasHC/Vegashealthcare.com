  **Uplifting Teens, Creating Futures**

  At Ignite Treatment Centers, teen mental health is our priority. We want to provide struggling teens with a safe and welcoming environment within which they can feel at home, as well as receiving the specialized treatment and support they need, tailored exactly for them. Our high levels of clinical and evidence-based care mean that any resident of our residential treatment center can feel fully supported around the clock with their recovery needs.

  Through our work, we understand that not only do we need to provide mental health care and treatment for the mind, but we also need to do so while nurturing and supporting a growing individual who is developing into an adult.

  We specialize in treatment for a wide variety of issues that struggling teens may be battling with, including:

  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Trauma treatment
  - Behavioral issues
  - Mood disorders
  - Drug and alcohol dependency
  - Gaming and social media addiction
