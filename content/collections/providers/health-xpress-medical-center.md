  Welcome to Health XPress Medical Center. Since opening our doors, we’ve been welcoming patients seeking treatment and medical services. We take great pride in providing our community with high quality, patient-centric healthcare.


  For the convenience of our patients, we offer a multitude of services from primary care to urgent care needs that other offices may not provide (Weight Loss Programs, IV Hydration, Covid Testing, and Much More). We are open 7 days a week, accept walk-ins and same day appointments. We also have a Spanish speaking provider and Spanish speaking medical assistant on staff.
