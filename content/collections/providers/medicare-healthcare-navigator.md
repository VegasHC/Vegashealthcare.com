  I am proud to co-teach the ABCs of Medicare classes at the UNLV/OLLI program and enjoy helping seniors navigate their way through Medicare-related topics. I focus on educating and assisting seniors with Medicare-related topics. Medicare recipients can sit down with me and review their Medicare plan as well as view alternative options that might offer lower costs or increased benefits. My services are a no cost to you- always. Too many seniors do not have sufficient coverage while thinking they do. This can be damaging when huge medical bills arrive. I look at each individual's needs and assess which plan will fit them best. Always choose a local agent who will be your personal consultant for Medicare in Las Vegas. Call me for the kind of care you deserve.
