description: |-
  For over 20 years, Woundtech has delivered advanced wound care services to patients to drive higher rates of healing and improve quality of life, resulting in better access to care and lower cost. Our clinicians (Podiatrists, NPs & Pas) specialize in wound management and follow evidence-based guidelines to deliver superior outcomes. They are trained as advanced wound care specialist working in collaboration with the patients Primary Care Physician (PCP). Like PCPs, our clinicians write and change orders at point of care.

  By connecting to PCPs to obtain referrals in the earliest stage of a wound, we are able to deliver prompt starts of care and select the correct healing pathway for higher healing rates at reduced costs. For chronic slower healing population, the focus shifts to avoidance of infection, hospitalizations, amputations and improved quality of life. In addition, we can monitor higher risk patients who are likely to redevelop wounds due to underlying health issues.

  Woundtech has completed over 3.5 million visits for over 200,000 wound care patients and we enjoy a patient satisfaction score in excess of 95%.
