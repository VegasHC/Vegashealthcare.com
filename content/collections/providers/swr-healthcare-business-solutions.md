  My introduction to healthcare in Las Vegas started 20 years ago. I was managing an accounting office in a major casino, my husband was in the motorcycle division of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept, and at the time we had a 3 year old and 5 month old. Two days before Christmas, my husband was on duty when a woman ran a stop sign and hit him. He has been a paraplegic ever since.

  This experience thrust me into the Las Vegas healthcare system, where an outsider could see that the bar for quality needed to be raised. That time in my life planted a seed in me to be a part of the change for good in which I would get that opportunity 14 years later. 

   Once my children were independent, I was introduced to a wonderful leader at Dignity Health. I told her my story and passion for wanting to help make change in the Las Vegas valley healthcare. She provided me the opportunity to learn patient throughput, compliance, payor dynamics, and hospital operations on a fast track. It was then that I realized my talent and passion lied in assessing a business, and zeroing in on its needs. I stayed there 7 years learning the craft of what makes a healthcare business successful and even opened a brand new hospital along the way. 

  That journey has brought me here to owning my own business and helping other Las Vegas  healthcare community businesses succeed. It would be my honor to help you!
