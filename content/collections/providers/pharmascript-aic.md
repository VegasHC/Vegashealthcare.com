description: 'At PharmaScript we offer both conventional and alternative infusion therapiesâ€” everything from post-transplant therapy and IV antibiotics to stem cell therapy and vitamin cocktails. Our certified nursing staff are trained and certified in all aspects of complex and chronic infusion therapy, and because infused medications call for the most exact management requirements, our infusion centers have an on-site pharmacist at each location to ensure the safety and efficacy of all infusions. We offer weekend appointments and flexible scheduling to fit your needs.'
