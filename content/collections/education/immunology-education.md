Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis are examples of autoimmune diseases, where the immune system loses its ability to distinguish self from non-self. Understanding autoimmunity is vital in developing therapies that restore immune balance and alleviate the associated symptoms.'
