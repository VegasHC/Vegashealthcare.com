            text: "For home health patients and caregivers in Las Vegas, understanding the heart's basic anatomy and functions is vital. The heart, roughly the size of a clenched fist and nestled between the lungs, is the body's powerhouse, pumping essential nutrients and oxygen to every part. It consists of four chambers and valves, orchestrating the flow of blood in a precise rhythm. This understanding is crucial for recognizing abnormalities and maintaining heart health at home."
