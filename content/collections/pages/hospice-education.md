Hospice is an alternative to traditional medicine that is centered on palliative care; \_the management of a patient’s pain and symptoms so that every moment can be as comfortable and rewarding as possible. Hospice care is an affirmation of life that focuses on comfortable, pain-free care when a loved one is faced with a terminal illness. Hospice is comfort care intended to give those with a terminal diagnosis the best possible quality of life. The goal of hospice care is to promote a life free of pain and discomfort for the patient, as well as support their loved ones."

Hospice also supports you in saying goodbye to your loved one, when the time comes. Religious or spiritual traditions and personal faith can play an important role in a patient’s physical and emotional well-being, as well as the family’s own comfort too. Chaplain services are available to meet these often complex needs. Hospice care even includes the help of volunteers that provide extra relief to families. Volunteers may run errands, provide companionship to the patient, do light housekeeping or sit with your loved one, so you can attend to personal matters.'

But while advanced medical care can do wonders for people with life-limiting illnesses, it can also become exhausting and counter-productive. Still, we keep trying, because to do otherwise feels like giving up. At some point, a decision may have to be made – not about ceasing all care, but about weighing the benefits of a certain course of treatment against the burdens of that treatment. What matters most may not be more time, but the ability to more fully enjoy the time we have with those we love. Hospice care provides hope by giving patients a chance to live their lives without being debilitated by pain and exhausted by unnecessary medical treatments and hospital visits. Hospice care also provides caregivers the support they need physically, emotionally and spiritually. The hospice team will make sure that the caregiver is fully informed and well prepared to care for their loved one to the best of their ability.'

Patients can continue to receive hospice services indefinitely, as long as they continue to meet the medical criteria as outlined by Medicare. Patients are assessed regularly during each certification period (which is twice in the first 180 days of service, and then every 60 days thereafter). As long as the patient continues to meet Medicare criteria, they can continue to receive hospice support, indefinitely.'

A patient may start hospice care for terminal cancer, but if they also have high blood pressure, this needs to be treated, to keep them comfortable. Our primary goal with hospice care is to keep the patient as comfortable as possible, promoting the highest quality of life. This allows our patients and their loved ones to focus on the things that are most important to them.'

The hospice team which includes physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants and social workers, make regular visits to provide skilled care. If a patient experiences a crisis, such as unmanaged pain, respiratory distress, or unmanaged anxiety, Medicare has options for higher levels of care. These include Continuous Care at home, or General Inpatient Care, until the crisis resolves. Both of these levels of care are intended for short term, acute crisis management. Once the crisis is resolved, the patient returns to routine care wherever they call home. To learn more about the hospice levels of care, please see Four Levels of Hospice Care, below.'

While this includes patients with cancer, some of the other diagnosis we see are end stage diseases such as lung diseases (COPD, emphysema), heart disease, kidney disease, Parkinson’s, ALS, Alzheimer’s and other Dementia’s. We also see patients that have multiple chronic illnesses, that when looked at together, make their health fragile and shorten their life expectancy. Medicare is concerned with the patients prognosis- what do we think the likely outcome of the disease will be, if it continues to run its’ course as expected.'

Hospice professionals are experts in pain and symptom management, but that is just the beginning. Hospice care involves a team of experts that offer patients and their family’s emotional and spiritual support as well. Hospice care is individualized and focuses on helping our patients and their loved ones best cope with their illness in a holistic manner, treating the whole individual, not just their disease.'

            text: 'A referral to hospice care can be made by anyone, not just a physician or healthcare professional. A patient, their family or loved ones can request an evaluation to see if they qualify to receive hospice care. Qualifications to receive this benefit include being diagnosed with a “life-limiting illness” with a life expectancy of 6 months or less (if the disease were to follow its expected course). There are no specific age or disease restrictions – any disease that is in the terminal stages may qualify someone to receive hospice care. Patients can continue to receive hospice care for an indefinite period of time, as long as they continue to meet the guidelines and criteria as set forth by Medicare. Each case is reviewed at set periods of time, to ensure they continue to meet criteria. A patient can choose to stop hospice care at any time, for any reason; for example, to pursue aggressive treatment.'

Hospice care can provide innumerable benefits to those with life-limiting illnesses, and their loved ones. But there are many hospice care misconceptions and it is important to learn as much as possible about how hospice care might benefit you, or your loved one. We have many choices about the services we receive toward the end of life, and hospice care is an important one to consider.'
