            text: "Las Vegas is located in the Mojave Desert, which means it has a hot and dry climate. Summers can be scorching with temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are mild with temperatures in the 50s and 60s, but the desert can get chilly at night. It's important to consider if you can handle the heat and if you're comfortable living in a desert climate."
