The atria are the upper chambers of the heart, and their main function is to receive blood returning to the heart from the rest of the body. The ventricles are the lower chambers of the heart and are responsible for pumping blood out of the heart and into the arteries.'

            text: "The heart's functions can be summarized into two main categories: the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation. Systemic circulation involves the pumping of oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the organs and tissues. Once the blood has delivered its oxygen and nutrients, it returns to the right atrium of the heart through the veins, and the process repeats. Pulmonary circulation, on the other hand, involves the pumping of oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation, and then the oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium for systemic circulation."
