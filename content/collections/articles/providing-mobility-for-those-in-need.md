If you, your organization, or your corporation would like to sponsor a full container of wheelchairs to a specific country, you have the choice of two container sizes. Regardless of the size, all shipments include spare parts; custom logo embroidery; and Wheelchair Foundation’s legendary commitment to provide hope, freedom, and mobility to individuals in need and without access to wheelchairs.'
