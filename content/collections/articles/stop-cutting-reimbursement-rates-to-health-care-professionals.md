        text: 'In 2024, Physicians who treat patients with Medicare face a potential 3.37% cut in reimbursement payments, as proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). After decades of such cuts, no last-minute “fix” will be sufficient. Instead, it is time for meaningful changes to how Medicare pays physicians who treat our aging loved ones and neighbors.'

        text: 'Physicians, particularly those serving underrepresented populations, find themselves at a crossroads. The relentless reduction in their reimbursements exacerbates the challenge of retaining qualified medical professionals in these critical institutions. These physicians play a pivotal role in offering health care services to communities abandoned by mainstream health care providers, and the continued threat of reduced reimbursements undermines their ability to attract and retain skilled physicians.'

        text: 'To avert an impending crisis, Congress must act urgently and decisively. Immediate steps include preventing the scheduled 3.37% payment reduction from taking effect on January 1, 2024. This will require new legislation in Congress, and I urge Senator Catherine Cortez Masto to take the lead on that. A more comprehensive and forward-looking solution lies in the passage of H.R. 6683, known as " Preserving Seniors’ Access to Physicians Act of 2023." This legislation proposes a permanent inflation-based update to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.'

Reforms should prioritize simplicity, reflect real-world physician practice costs, and provide predictability for both physicians and CMS. Failure to act promptly risks not only the financial viability of medical practices but, more critically, the accessibility and quality of health care for vulnerable communities nationwide. We must not overlook the urgent need to safeguard the foundations of our health care system for the well-being of all Nevada’s people.'
