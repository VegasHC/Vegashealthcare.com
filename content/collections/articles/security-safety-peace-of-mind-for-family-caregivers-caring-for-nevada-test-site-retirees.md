title: 'Security, Safety & Peace of Mind for Family Caregivers Caring for Nevada Test Site Retirees'
author: 'Nuclear Care Partners'
snippet: 'Caring for a loved one can be equally rewarding and challenging. While it’s easy to feel overwhelmed  when trying to juggle the other parts of your life, including your ability to work, engage in social  interactions and relationships, and maintaining your own health, you play a vital role in your loved one’s  life. The love and support you pour out for your ill family member can be incredibly spirit-lifting for both  you as the caregiver, and the one you are caring for. While it’s no secret that being a family caregiver can  come with inevitable stresses, there is security, safety, and peace of mind to be found in being a  directly employed caregiver, rather than an independent contractor.'
