        text: "At Silverado, we embrace the philosophy of normalization, meaning that we do NOT see dementia as a disability nor as a hindrance to aging gracefully and filled with joy and companionship. Dementia has no place at our site!! \_We look it in the eye and send it away as far as the East is from the West."
