snippet: "April 22, 2023 | Sunset Park | 9am-12pm The Out of the Darkness walks help raise funds for suicide prevention. Proceeds go directly to AFSPâ€™s lifesaving research, education, advocacy and survivor support programming. The Las Vegas walk is also an opportunity to be there for one another, including ourselves, when someone is struggling. By participating, you are stepping into a growing movement of people sending the message that suicide can be prevented and that together, we can do more to save lives and support everyone's mental health.  You can register for the walk at afsp.org/nevada"
