        text: 'Normal, healthy skin works to retain moisture. This provides protection from bacteria, irritants, and allergens. It is thought that eczema develops due to a gene variation that affects the skin’s ability to retain moisture and then loses the corresponding protection from the moisture. This allows the skin to be affected by environmental factors, irritants, and allergens. Further proof of the possibility of a genetic link is that eczema seems to run in families.'

Avoiding hot showers or hot baths is a good idea, as they can dry out your skin. Using a humidifier in the dry winter months is helpful. Limiting stress is key.'

        text: 'Atopic Dermatitis – The most common form of eczema, atopic dermatitis is chronic and inflammatory. Atopic dermatitis is related to asthma and hay fever, but it is not an allergy. Still, the immune system overreacting to irritants, whether inside or outside the body, is behind the chronic flare-ups. The symptoms listed above are for atopic dermatitis.'

Irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis are the most common forms. Symptoms include redness and rash, burning or swelling, and blisters that may weep or crust over. These occur on the area where contact was made.

        text: 'Neurodermatitis – This form of eczema starts with an itchy patch of skin. These occur in commonly scratched areas, and scratching then makes the areas more irritated and itchy. This itch-scratch cycle causes the affected skin to become thick and leathery. Neurodermatitis occurs in areas that can be reached and scratched: the head, neck, wrists, forearms, ankles, vulva, scrotum, and anus. Treatment success depends on the patient being able to resist the urge to rub or itch the affected areas, but this can be difficult as the itching can be intense.'

These spots can be very itchy and difficult to treat. It is thought that nummular dermatitis can be triggered by insect bites, reactions to skin inflammation, or dry skin in the winter.'

This form of eczema is common in infants and is known colloquially as “cradle cap.” In adults, it also commonly appears on the scalp. Symptoms may range from dry flakes (dandruff) to yellow, greasy scales with reddened skin. It’s thought that hormones play a role in this form of eczema.'
