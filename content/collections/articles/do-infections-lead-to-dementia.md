title: 'Do Infections Lead to Dementia?'
hero: eq.png
author: 'Irma Prettenhofer, Gerontologist'
snippet: 'The National Institute of Health cites that inflammation caused by infectious diseases can contribute to dementia. Furthermore, the National Center for Biotechnical Research provides a great historical view of how at the turn of the century, infectious disease represented a high risk of mortality for many. One condition, neurosyphilis, was directly related to the cause of a cognitive decline in that era. With the advent of antibiotic treatments, the line became blurry with the association of infectious diseases with dementia. The truth is that the risk for infectious-related complications increases with age due to the changes in the immune system’s response to disease.  We also know that inflammation in the brain leads to delirium or acute mental confusion. Some dementia-related disorders are reversible, and some are not. So it’s best to speak to your doctor and get the proper information. Early diagnosis is critical to having a greater quality of life, even in the discourse of a dementia-related disease journey.'

        text: "Infections can cause short-term memory decline which is reversible once the infection clears. But they can also lead to long-term cognitive impairment in people who are already on the trajectory toward dementia. In fact, infections can unmask dementia in people with subtle symptoms. Most of the cases of sudden confusion and rapidly progressive dementia in an elderly person are due to delirium caused by an infection. Urinary Tract Infections (UTI’s) and pneumonia can trigger acute confusion that comes on quickly, causing people to be incoherent, muddled, and disoriented. With proper hygienic perineal care, UTI’s can be prevented; Proper dental care can also prevent gum disease and reduce the risk of getting an infection.\_"
