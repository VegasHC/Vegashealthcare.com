        text: 'The COVID-19 vaccines are currently being administered throughout Nevada, the United States, and the world. At this time more than 44 million doses in 51 countries of one of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. In the United States, 14 million people have received the vaccine since December 14, 2020, with an average of 776,901 doses being administered per day last week. Many people, including frontline healthcare workers, have already received one or both doses of either the Pfizer or Modern vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019.'
