        text: "For many of us, some of our biggest fears include being alone at the end of our life.\_ Being alone in unfamiliar surroundings, away from family and loved ones, hooked up to machines and in pain.\_ But there is another option for end-of-life care that is available to all of us. An option that allows us to remain at home, surrounded by those we love, with our pain and symptoms well managed, so that we can fully enjoy the time we have left.\_ An option that provides compassion, respect, and dignity to each individual, known as In-Home Hospice Care."

        text: "In most common home hospice situations, the primary caregiver to the patient is a family member who attends to daily needs.\_ We understand that being a caregiver can be a daunting task, and at times, you may feel overwhelmed.\_ That is why a vital part of the care we provide is centered around supporting everyone involved with a patient, including family, loved ones and caregivers. Many different forms of support are offered under in-home hospice care. Nurses, certified nursing assistants (CNA’s), and physician attend and oversee a patient’s care on a regular basis. Social workers and counseling services are available for both the patient and family/caregiver, and are an important part of hospice team. Chaplains are available for spiritual visits and accommodations can be made for volunteer assistance, as well."
