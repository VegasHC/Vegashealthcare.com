author: 'Prestige Assisted Living at Mira Loma'
snippet: '“It takes a village.”  It’s a phrase often used when referring to raising children, but having a village is a lifelong need. That village becomes vital once a loved one starts showing signs of cognitive decline or receives a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.'

        text: 'As someone is telling a story, they may grasp for details or repeat themselves. Allow them space to do so – interrupting them or jumping in to finish their story can be discouraging and make them reluctant to try again in the future. Part of living with cognitive decline is exercising the brain through conversation.'

For instance, asking ‘What would you like to do today?’ forces them to consider options and try to come to a decision. Instead, ask “Would you like to go for a walk?” or offer another activity they enjoy. Yes or no questions help direct their focus.'
