title: 'New poll shows strong support for medical facility fee reforms'
hero: patientssittinginwaitingroom.jpg
snippet: 'A new poll by Morning Consult showed that 84 percent of voters identified health care costs as a top priority for Congress to address this year, encouraging policymakers to support targeted changes that lower fees and increase billing transparency. Nevadans are particularly concerned about the rising cost of health care. Last year, a staggering 65 percent experienced at least one health care affordability burden when compared to the previous year.'
