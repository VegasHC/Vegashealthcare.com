        text: 'Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) are a serious yet preventable complication that affects more than 2.5 million patients in the U.S. each year. arise from prolonged, unrelieved pressure, particularly in critically ill adult patients who are immobile and medically compromised, leading to extended hospital stays, increased costs, and reduced quality of life (Emory University, 2021; Gupta et al., 2020). The Joint Commission (2022) classifies HAPIs as a critical patient safety issue. With the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) no longer reimbursing hospitals for pressure injuries acquired during hospitalization, many facilities have implemented prevention protocols. However, inconsistent guidelines often overlook evidence-based education and training, leading to gaps in healthcare. These injuries lead to nearly 60,000 deaths and drive up healthcare costs by approximately $26 billion annually (National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel [NPIAP], 2022).'

        text: 'Despite prevention protocols, HAPI rates continue to rise—especially among critically ill patients. A primary cause? Inadequate staff training and inconsistent application of evidence-based strategies (Coventry et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2020). A new quality improvement initiative is tackling the issue by focusing on what research shows works best: ongoing education.'
