Every cell, organ, and tissue of our bodies needs water to function properly, and if you don’t provide your body with the water it needs it will lead to dehydration. Water helps your body to regulate your body temperature, your heart rate, & your blood pressure.'

        text: 'A reasonable goal for most people is to shoot for 48-64 oz of water per day, with more if you are very active or workout rigorously. Besides water, eating foods that are high in water content can help you to stay hydrated as well. Melons (watermelons are 90% water), oranges, & grapefruits great choices as well as celery, cucumbers, & romaine lettuce.'

        text: '3. Add fruit, vegetables, or herbs to your water. Adding fruit can give you a fun change in the taste without adding in any unnecessary calories. Try lemons, limes, or oranges, freeze chunks of watermelon and use them instead of ice. Or for a fresh flavor try cucumbers and mint. There are lots of fruit infused water recipes online.'

        text: '4. Start small, set a goal, treat yourself. When I started being mindful of the water I was drinking I couldn’t go from drinking only pop and sweet tea to drinking 8 glasses of water per day. I set a goal to drink 1 bottle per day, then 2 bottles of water per day, then 3, and so on. Treat yourself with a different drink of choice at dinner if you met your goal of water for that day.'
