        text: 'First, how far in advance are your MD appointments? Three to six months is typical. But why? So many clients, or is time limited because the MDs might be sharing an office? Often the receptionists are true Palace Guards who hold firm to all the rules. Listening allows them to get information prior to report instead of filtering vital information. Second, once you’ve checked in, been weighed, get your vital signs taken by a Nurse or MA, remove your clothes and read old magazines, how long have you been there?'

        text: 'Once the MD/NP/PA pops in, what is the time invested? “Any changes? Taking the meds. as prescribed? Anything else? See you in three months.” When patients ask the writers how to get their questions answered when they are in the appointment, they are told to write down their questions on an index card and hold the card throughout the visit. There is nothing worse than getting in the car and saying: “I meant to ask…., but I didn’t have a chance”.'

        text: 'Let’s spend a few sentences talking about acute care as opposed to the outpatient scenarios described above. Most Insurance companies are determining the extent of care because they are paying for the care or not. That’s why little to nothing occurs if you are hospitalized over a weekend; few tests; little or no Physical Therapy and/or Occupational Therapy. In addition, staffing is usually a continuous issue. Few Nurses results in brief encounters with patients/families; doing what they need to do (adjust IVs/give meds,etc). Not much time is given by Nurses who are short-staffed.'

        text: 'Unfortunately, many Hospital Corporations are pyramidal in structure when you connect the dots top-down. The implication of that is that the TOP may not be aware of what’s happening DOWNWARD. Staffing issues can result in creating “Stepford employees”: Staff who are assigned more patients and become numb to what they are doing. Often, these folks may have another job because the pay isn’t enough. These issues drain productivity which can have a negative impact on patient care.'
