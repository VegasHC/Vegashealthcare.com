snippet: 'Nursing homes are an integral piece of our health care system, providing personalized care to seniors in a loving and nurturing environment. Long term care communities are not only medical facilities, but they are also homes for thousands of women and men across our state. And at facilities such as mine, our dedicated caregivers are the heart of the operation.'

        text: 'Unfortunately, the reality is that the last few years have been tough for the long term care workforce. Because of pandemic-related burnout and staff turnover, Nevada long term care facilities – and the health care sector as a whole – are in a rebuilding phase as we look to address long-standing staffing shortages that significantly worsened during the pandemic.'

We have worked to offer generous benefits to staff, including substantial amounts of overtime, but it’s a fine line to walk. The last thing we want is for long hours to cause additional burnout and turnover.'

We need help from our leaders in Washington – not only for the vulnerable seniors we care for today, but for the millions who will call a long term care facility home in the future. The fundamental question is: how do we do it?'

Fining facilities that fail to hire workers who do not exist is like fining them for failing to squeeze water out of a rock. Fortunately, collaborative solutions do exist that can help grow our workforce in a sustainable way. This is where state and federal policymakers need to step in.'
