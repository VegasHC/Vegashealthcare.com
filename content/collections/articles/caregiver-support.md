        text: 'If you currently care for a loved one in your home, we can help. CompassionCare Hospice’s team of professionals can show you how to provide medications and treatments to your loved one. Our Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA) can help see to the patient’s personal hygiene needs. Hospice support can also arrange in-home physician visits if necessary, so you don’t have to go to the doctor’s office. Plus, we can provide respite care which can allow the hospice caregiver a much needed break. Your loved one can be treated on an inpatient basis for a time, while you get much needed rest, take a vacation, deal with an unexpected emergency, or just take a day to yourself.'

        text: 'Hospice caregiver support also includes the help and guidance of social workers who are assigned to each patient and their family. These individuals help you work through practical matters-such as, confusing paperwork, insurance forms, Medicare forms and other legal documents. The social worker coordinates respite stays and can even help find alternative placement when necessary. They can also arrange for additional emotional, spiritual, and volunteer support when it’s needed.'
