        text: 'I started meditating in my early childhood when my brother was termi­nally ill.  Through meditation, I began developing tools and techniques to help cope with the stress, anxiety, and fear of his illness.  I was too young to handle the stress and fear that surrounded my daily life and consumed both my family, and myself.  Developing these tools and breath techniques was my true escape. '

        text: 'It all stemmed from my brother’s illness and my awareness of suffering and anxiety that affects the entire world.  I knew I had to create a way to handle these struggles, not only for myself and my family, but for those in need globally.  Stress is known to be the #1 cause of disease in our world to­day.  That’s why I am so passionate about helping others to alleviate stress.  As I always say, “Short breath, short life.  Long breath, long life.”'

        text: 'Remember these keys factors: You are never alone; When you need help, don’t be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or a specialized professional; Remind yourself it can always be worse; Instead of asking yourself, “Why me?,” remember that it’s not your fault; De­velop proper breathing techniques. (For example, inhale through your nose to the count of eight, hold your breath to the count of eight, and exhale through your mouth.  Repeat three times or more for best results to alleviate stress.)'
