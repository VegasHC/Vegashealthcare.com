        text: "The reason it is important to hire an experienced attorney is his or her experience.\_ The insurance adjuster is well trained in claims management and claim values.\_ An attorney is better trained at claims management and claim values.\_ When lay people try to negotiate their own cases, they are the only one who does not understand claims management and value.\_ Most often, the adjuster will take gross advantage of the claimant.\_"

        text: "At G. Dallas Horton & Associates we have 26 years of experience.\_ We know claims management and we know the value of claims.\_ G. Dallas Horton & Associates with only two attorneys and 17 total employees has collected over a quarter of a billion dollars in settlements for its clients.\_ Look at the law firms that claim they have collected one billion dollars.\_ Not one of those firms has fewer than 15 attorneys.\_ At G. Dallas Horton & Associates we are unimpressed with their collection.\_ At G. Dallas Horton & Associates, we are much less concerned about the volume of our cases and much more concerned about each individual plaintiff’s recovery.\_ Anyone can do the math.\_ $250,000,000.00 divided by 2 is $125,000,000.00 per lawyer.\_ We have a much lower volume, but do very well because of our focus on individual recoveries.\_ One billion dollars divided by 15 is only $66,666,666.67 per lawyer.\_ Some of these firms have over 30 lawyers and they actually brag about collecting one billion in settlements for their clients.\_ These firms do a great deal of volume.\_ They sign up between 150 and 250 people per month.\_ When you visit these firms, the owner does not represent you.\_"
