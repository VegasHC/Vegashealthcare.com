        text: 'Jean Watson, the American nurse theorist, and professor states “Nurses are a unique kind. They have this insatiable need to care for others, which is both their greatest strength and fatal flaw.” The need to care for others often leave us neglecting our own self-care. As a Registered nurse, with many years of experience, I understand the need to always be there and the satisfaction to know that your hands and touch, your inspiration and care has touched the lives of so many in a positive and fruitful way. I also know how important it is to garner our talents and masterfully use it to help and heal others. The need to care for others always seem to take precedence over the need to care for ourselves. There is a balance that musts be attain. With this goal in mind StaffinGenious was design to help you maintain and achieve a balance. We must be able to nurture ourselves and take care of our talents. This will allow us to better take care of others and be more impactful with our care. StaffinGenious mission is to help you find the balance you need to attend to your community while taking care of your talent.'
