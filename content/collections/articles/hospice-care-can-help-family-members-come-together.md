With the guidance of the hospice team, we can assure that families and loved ones will have all the tools and resources needed to give the best care possible.'

        text: 'Hospice care can help family members come together. Family meetings, often led by a hospice a social worker or nurse, can help you talk about your feelings, cope with the issues, and help guide the family in making the best choices for everyone. Hospice also supports you in saying goodbye to your loved one, when the time comes. Religious or spiritual traditions and personal faith can play an important role in a patient’s physical and emotional well-being, as well as the family’s own comfort too. Chaplain services are available to meet these often complex needs. Hospice care even includes the help of volunteers that provide extra relief to families. Volunteers may run errands, provide companionship to the patient, do light housekeeping or sit with your loved one, so you can attend to personal matters.'
