message: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Emily McAdow and I am the co-founder of our newly formed non-profit, Pinecone Dash Foundation. Our mission is raising awareness to our EMS system and first responders. We started this in honor of my late mother, you can read more of her story on our webpage if you are interested. She was an incredible person and loved to help others. \r\nWe are putting on our third annual event in Las Vegas, NV on October 28th, as a 5K and 1 Mile run with proceeds being given to Red Rock Search and Rescue and as EMT scholarships. We also just had our first annual event in Stephenville, TX in April as well. With our last two events we have been able to put 9 students through EMT school thus far. We are looking for some bigger support/partnerships of any kind so we can continue to do the same for our communities and grow our brand along side brands we know and love ourselves. We will have our two event annually in Stephenville, TX and Las Vegas, NV. We'd be honored if your company would be interested in becoming a sponsor for our annual events. Here is a link to our website, you can read more of our Mom's story and see a bit more about our organization. https://www.pinecone5kdash.org\r\n\r\nI have a sponsorship form I can send if you may be interested. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about us!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nEmily McAdow\r\nPresident\r\nPinecone Dash Foundation\r\n(702) 460-2814"
