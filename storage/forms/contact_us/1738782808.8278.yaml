message: "My name is Juliette Turner, and I am a current Masters student at Roseman University of Health Sciences, a not-for-profit health sciences university in Southern Nevada. As part of my thesis project, I am conducting a comprehensive survey focused on barriers to care among patients diagnosed with diabetes.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to a list-serve of your members who may provide valuable insight about this topic because they work with this patient population. It would be a huge contribution to my thesis project which seeks to prepare innovative training materials for providers to best serve these patients. \r\n\r\n Please let me know if you have policies or processes that I may follow to distribute this survey to your organizationâ€™s members.\r\nhttps://forms.office.com/r/RmDMWzWpFf\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJuliette Turner\r\nMasters of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSPS) Candidate 2026\r\nRoseman University of Health Sciences, College of Graduate Studies\r\nTransforming Education.
