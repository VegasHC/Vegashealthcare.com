    description: 'Monicos Pharmacy is a full retail independent pharmacy that treats customers as people and not as numbers or statistics. We offer a wide range of generic and brand name medications, and we also provide non-sterile compounding to facilitate specific needs. We work with all local physicians, and we will deliver medications to you when you are unable to come to the pharmacy, due to either restrictions and/or inconvenience. We are dedicated to patient care, removing obstacles from both physician and patient. Our goal isn’t just to maintain each patient’s health, but to improve each patient’s health outcomes through education, consultation, medication adherence, and establishment of a successful provider-patient-pharmacy relationship.'
