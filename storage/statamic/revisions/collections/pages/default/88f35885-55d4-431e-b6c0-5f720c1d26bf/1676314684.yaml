                text: 'Infusion therapy — also known as IV therapy — involves administering medications intravenously. This is done by injecting a needle directly into the patient’s arm. It allows for much more efficient treatment of chronic illnesses since it delivers medicine, antibiotics, and/or hydration directly into the bloodstream. As a result, there’s a higher absorption rate and you can obtain relief faster.'
